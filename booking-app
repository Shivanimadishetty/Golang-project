package main // This is the starting point of a Go program. It declares the package name.
// "main" is the entry point of execution when the program is run.

import "fmt"

// This imports the "fmt" package which is used for formatted I/O operations like printing to the console.

//func main() {
	// The main function is the entry point of the program. Execution starts here.

	// Variables are used to store data that can change during program execution.
	// Syntax: var variableName = value
	var exhibitionName = "Art Exhibition"

	// 'exhibitionName' is a variable storing the name of the exhibition.

	// Constants are similar to variables, but their value cannot be changed once set.
	// Syntax: const constantName = value
	const totalTickets = "50"
	// 'totalTickets' is a constant representing the total number of tickets. It won't change during execution.

	// Another variable to keep track of how many tickets are still available.
	var remainingTickets = "50"
	// 'remainingTickets' can be updated later when tickets are booked.

	// fmt.Printf is used to print formatted output.
	// %v is a placeholder that gets replaced by the value of the variable.
	fmt.Printf("Welcome to my %v Hope you'll have a great time \n", exhibitionName)
	// This line greets the user and includes the name of the exhibition using the 'exhibitionName' variable.

	fmt.Printf("We have a total of %v tickets available and the number of tickets remaining are %v \n", totalTickets, remainingTickets)
	// This line tells users how many total and remaining tickets are available.

	fmt.Println("Book your tickets here")
	// This simply prints a message prompting the user to book tickets.

	//var userName1 string
	//var userTickets int

	//userName1 = "Ipsu"
	//userTickets = 2

	// or we can also define data types this way

	///var ItemsBrought int = 3

	//userName2 := "Cyrus"
	// no need to use var keyword if := is used, but this only works for variables and not constants

	//fmt.Printf("A user %v bought %v tickets and purchased %v items\n", userName1, userTickets, ItemsBrought)
	//fmt.Printf("A user %v bought %v tickets and purchased %v items\n", userName2, userTickets, ItemsBrought)
